# IDE Vimize Settings

Might-be-useful configurations to use some IDEs or code editor in Vim style, currently planning to include:

* Vim (original settings)
* Visual Studio Code

## Personal Preferences

Here are my personal preferences when using vim, which I will try to simulate when vimizing other IDEs.

### Clipboard

* Use system clipboard for unnamed register

### Tab Switching

* Key "ctrl + ," for "previous tab" (gT)
* Key "ctrl + ." for "next tab" (gt)

### File Explorer

I personally use [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) in vim for file explorer, with some customized key mappings. In other IDEs, I will try to simulate some of its features.

* Key "ctrl+n" in for "switch to / switch back from file explorer" (at least in normal mode)
* Key "m a" for "new file / directory" in file explorer (may use "m A" for directory in some IDEs)
* Key "m d" for "delete file" in file explorer
* Key "m r" for "rename file / directory"
* Key "g s" for "open in a split view"
* (In non-Vim editors) Disable "ctrl+w" for "closing current tab"
